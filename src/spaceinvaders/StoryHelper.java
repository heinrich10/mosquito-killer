Such insect bites cause the transmission of Plasmodium parasite, which may propagate in the liver and in the blood stream as well. According to the Department of Health (DOH), the Philippines is on track towards becoming a Malaria-free country by 2020. Malaria was included as the country’s 6th Millennium Development Goal.  In 2010, funds were allocated to 40 malaria-endemic provinces in the country. Rural places are found to be susceptible to malaria due to the forested topography, lack of enclosed dwellings, and especially places with undrained rainfall water from plateaus.  Despite efforts of eradicating the disease, WHO also stated the Philippines is included in the Western Pacific Region, where in Malaria is still widespread. In 2012, US$24 million was allotted to contribute in malaria eradication.</html>";

However, the presence of mosquitoes increases after rainfall due to the accumulation of stagnant water, where the mosquitoes usually thrive. </html>";
